an XT, and offer different rendering options\n\n@dataclass\nclass Card():\n    title: str\n    image: str\n    description: str\n    # button_links: list of text, link pairs maybe\n\n    def __xt__(self, uiframework='semanticui'):\n        if uiframework == 'semanticui':\n            ...\n        elif uiframework == 'frankenui':\n            ...\n        elif uiframework == 'bootstrap':\n            ...\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unknown uiframework {uiframework}\")\n\nThis would be hard to maintain, though. I feel like a system to allow devs to make their own CSS framework plugins for XT would be nice.\nDaniel suggested using dataclasses like in his blog.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet suggested renderers for each framework could look like:\n\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Callable, Dict\n\n# Global registry for renderers\nrenderer_registry: Dict[str, Callable] = {}\n\ndef register_renderer(framework: str):\n    \"\"\"Decorator to register a renderer for a specific framework.\"\"\"\n    def decorator(func: Callable):\n        renderer_registry[framework] = func\n        return func\n    return decorator\n\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Card:\n    title: str\n    description: str\n    image: Optional[str] = None\n    button_links: List[Tuple[str, str]] = ()\n\n    def __xt__(self, uiframework='semanticui'):\n        if uiframework not in renderer_registry:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No renderer registered for framework: {uiframework}\")\n        return renderer_registry[uiframework](self)\n\n\n@register_renderer('semanticui')\ndef render_semanticui(card: Card):\n    content = [\n        Div(card.title, cls='header'),\n        Div(card.description, cls='description')\n    ]\n    if card.image:\n        content.insert(0, Div(Img(src=card.image, cls='ui image'), cls='image'))\n    \n    buttons = [\n        A(text, href=link, cls='ui button')\n        for text, link in card.button_links\n    ]\n\n    return Div(\n        Div(*content, cls='content'),\n        *buttons,\n        cls='ui card'\n    )\n\nLet’s try rendering out a simple card with this\n\nhannah_card = Card('Hannah', 'Hannah is a girl who likes to dance.', image='hannah.jpg', button_links=[('Add Friend', '#')])\nhannah_card.__xt__()\n\n&lt;div class=\"ui card\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"image\"&gt;\n      &lt;img src=\"hannah.jpg\" class=\"ui image\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;Hannah&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"description\"&gt;Hannah is a girl who likes to dance.&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"ui button\"&gt;Add Friend&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nNote: I’ve learned better patterns since I wrote this.

Let’s break it down step-by-step and analyze its components:\n\nImports:\nfrom fasthtml import FastHTML, Component\nThis imports the necessary classes from the FastHTML framework.

I can tell from your AdviceComponent that you're used to templates in\n     web development. Instead of templates, FastHTML uses Python functions to generate HTML \n     in a functional programming style. Paul Graham wrote about the power of functional\n     programming for web development in https://paulgraham.com/avg.html. What do you think\n     of his ideas, and are they applicable to functional programming in Python?\"\"\")\n\nThank you for the clarification and for sharing that insightful article by Paul Graham, Audrey! You’re absolutely right that I initially approached this from a template-based perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to shift my thinking.\nLet’s dive into Paul Graham’s ideas and their applicability to functional programming in Python, especially in the context of web development with FastHTML:\n\nBottom-up Programming: Graham emphasizes the power of building a program from the bottom up, creating a language suited to your problem. FastHTML seems to embody this principle by allowing developers to build web applications using Python functions as building blocks. This approach enables creating a domain-specific language for web development within Python itself.\nSuccinctness: Graham argues that more powerful languages allow programmers to write shorter, more expressive code. FastHTML’s functional approach to generating HTML could lead to more concise code compared to template-based systems, as each HTML element becomes a function call, potentially reducing boilerplate.\nInteractive Development: Lisp’s REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is praised for allowing interactive development. While Python already has a REPL, FastHTML’s functional approach might make it easier to test and develop components interactively, as you’re working with pure Python functions.\nMacros and Metaprogramming: While Python doesn’t have Lisp-like macros, its decorators and metaprogramming capabilities can be powerful. FastHTML might leverage these features for things like component lifecycle management or state handling.\nBlurring the Line Between Code and Data: In Lisp, code is data. While not to the same extent, FastHTML’s approach of representing HTML structure as nested function calls does blur the line between code and data in a way that traditional template systems don’t.\nFlexibility and Extensibility: Graham talks about the flexibility of building the language up to suit the problem. With FastHTML, you could potentially create higher-order functions that generate complex HTML structures, effectively extending the “language” of your web application.\n\nApplicability to Python and FastHTML:\n\nFunctional Paradigm: While Python isn’t a purely functional language like Lisp, it does support functional programming concepts. FastHTML leverages this to create a declarative way of building web UIs.\nExpressiveness: Python’s readability and expressiveness align well with Graham’s ideas about powerful languages. FastHTML seems to extend this expressiveness to HTML generation.\nCustomization: The functional approach allows for easy customization and abstraction. You could create your own shorthand functions for commonly used structures, similar to how Lisp programmers might create their own macros.\nReduced Context Switching: By using Python for both logic and presentation, FastHTML reduces the cognitive load of switching between different languages or paradigms.\nTestability: Functional components could be easier to unit test as they’re just Python functions, aligning with Graham’s ideas about the benefits of functional programming for debugging and maintenance.\n\nWhile Python may not offer all the metaprogramming power of Lisp, FastHTML’s approach does seem to apply many of Graham’s ideas about the benefits of functional programming in web development. It creates a more unified, expressive, and potentially more maintainable way of building web applications.\nWhat are your thoughts on this, Audrey?

I’d be happy to help you understand the core of FastHTML. Let’s go through this code together and break it down:\n\nImports and Setup:\nimport asyncio\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Dict, List, Optional, Union\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse\nfrom fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles\nThis section imports necessary modules, including FastAPI for the web server functionality.\nHTML Class:\nclass HTML:\n    def __init__(self, tag: str, *children: Any, **attrs: Any):\n        self.tag = tag\n        self.children = children\n        self.attrs = attrs\n\n    def __call__(self, *children: Any, **attrs: Any) -&gt; 'HTML':\n        return HTML(self.tag, *children, **{**self.attrs, **attrs})\n\n    def __str__(self) -&gt; str:\n        attr_str = ' '.join(f'{k}=\"{v}\"' for k, v in self.attrs.items())\n        children_str = ''.join(str(child) for child in self.children)\n        return f\"&lt;{self.tag} {attr_str}&gt;{children_str}&lt;/{self.tag}&gt;\"\nThis class represents an HTML element. It can be instantiated with a tag name, children, and attributes. The __call__ method allows for easy creation of new elements based on existing ones. The __str__ method generates the actual HTML string.\nComponent Class:\nclass Component:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._state = {}\n        self._watchers = {}\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name: str, value: Any):\n        if name.startswith('_'):\n            super().__setattr__(name, value)\n        else:\n            self._state[name] = value\n            if name in self._watchers:\n                for watcher in self._watchers[name]:\n                    watcher(value)\n\n    def __getattr__(self, name: str) -&gt; Any:\n        if name in self._state:\n            return self._state[name]\n        raise AttributeError(f\"'{self.__class__.__name__}' object has no attribute '{name}'\")\n\n    def watch(self, attr: str, callback: Callable[[Any], None]):\n        if attr not in self._watchers:\n            self._watchers[attr] = []\n        self._watchers[attr].append(callback)\n\n    def render(self) -&gt; Union[str, HTML]:\n        raise NotImplementedError\nThis class is the base for all components.

And today, we are making it ever better, with the launch of _Claudette_.\n\nClaudette makes Anthropic’s SDK, which is used for working with Claude, much more convenient. The SDK works well, but it is quite low level – it leaves the developer to do a lot of stuff manually. That’s a lot of extra work and boilerplate. Claudette automates pretty much everything that can be automated, whilst providing full control. Amongst the features provided:\n\n  * A `Chat` class that creates stateful dialogs\n  * Support for _prefill_ , which tells Claude what to use as the first few words of its response\n  * Convenient image support\n  * Simple and convenient support for Claude’s new Tool Use API.\n\nIf you’re dying to get started, just `pip install claudette`, and follow along with the documentation.\n\nHere’s a quick demo to give you a taste of what’s possible…\n\n## A tour of Claudette\n\nThe main interface to Claudette is the `Chat` class, which provides a standard chat interface to Claude. If you use it in a Notebook environment, you even get nice little collapsible widgets with output details:\n\n```\nchat = Chat(model, sp=\"You are a helpful and concise assistant.\")\nchat(\"I'm Jeremy\")\n```\n\nHello Jeremy, it’s nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?\n\n  * id: msg_01Jc7nGNhYYVHnMYHGjLSUmP\n  * content: [{‘text’: “Hello Jeremy, it’s nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?”, ‘type’: ‘text’}]\n  * model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\n  * role: assistant\n  * stop_reason: end_turn\n  * stop_sequence: None\n  * type: message\n  * usage: {‘input_tokens’: 19, ‘output_tokens’: 20}\n\n```\nchat(\"What's my name?\")\n```\n\nYour name is Jeremy, as you just told me.\n\n  * id: msg_01QZNRNjfsrfPqeJB2rV75xT\n  * content: [{‘text’: ‘Your name is Jeremy, as you just told me.’, ‘type’: ‘text’}]\n  * model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\n  * role: assistant\n  * stop_reason: end_turn\n  * stop_sequence: None\n  * type: message\n  * usage: {‘input_tokens’: 47, ‘output_tokens’: 14}\n\nClaudette supports adding _prefill_ – i.e. the text we want Claude to assume the response starts with. Let’s try it out:\n\n```\nchat(\"Concisely, what is the meaning of life?\", prefill='According to Douglas Adams,')\n```\n\nAccording to Douglas Adams, “42.” More seriously, it’s often considered to be finding personal fulfillment, happiness, and purpose.\n\n  * id: msg_0127j5giEz86e5q8s4Qwe1DU\n  * content: [{‘text’: ‘According to Douglas Adams, “42.” More seriously, it's often considered to be finding personal fulfillment, happiness, and purpose.’, ‘type’: ‘text’}]\n  * model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\n  * role: assistant\n  * stop_reason: end_turn\n  * stop_sequence: None\n  * type: message\n  * usage: {‘input_tokens’: 81, ‘output_tokens’: 27}\n\nClaudette can also use external tools, by calling Python functions. We use docments to make defining Python functions as ergonomic as possible. Give each parameter (and the return value) a type, and a comment with the description of what it is, and Claudette will do the rest! As an example we’ll write a simple function that adds numbers together, and will tell us when it’s being called:\n\n```\ndef sums(\n    a:int,  # First thing to sum\n    b:int=1 # Second thing to sum\n) -&gt; int: # The sum of the inputs\n    \"Adds a + b.\"\n    print(f\"Finding the sum of {a} and {b}\")\n    return a + b\n```\n\nLet’s make Claude into a super-power arithmetic agent by adding the ability to multiply numbers too! (Yes OK this is a contrived example…)\n\n```\ndef mults(\n    a:int,  # First thing to multiply\n    b:int=1 # Second thing to multiply\n) -&gt; int: # The product of the inputs\n    \"Multiplies a * b.\"\n    print(f\"Finding the product of {a} and {b}\")\n    return a * b\n```\n\nTo use tools, pass a list of them to `Chat`:\n\n```\nchat = Chat(model, tools=[sums,mults])\n```\n\nTo run an “agent loop” which calls multiple tools automatically as needed to complete a task, use `toolloop`:\n\n```\nchat.toolloop('Calculate (6475849214+574892665)*2')\n```\n\n```\nFinding the sum of 6475849214 and 574892665\nFinding the product of 7050741879 and 2\n```\n\nNow we have our final result. Let’s put it all together:\n\nThe calculation (6475849214+574892665)*2 equals 14101483758.\n\nTo break it down: 1. 6475849214 + 574892665 = 7050741879 2. 7050741879 * 2 = 14101483758\n\nSo, the final answer is 14101483758.\n\n  * id: msg_01EbJoMjpckfEUauH6ePee4f\n  * content: [{‘text’: “Now we have our final result.

As everyone knows, when testing image APIs you have to use a cute puppy.\n\n```\nfn = Path('cute-puppy.jpg')\nimg = fn.read_bytes()\ndisplay.Image(filename=fn, width=200)\n```\n\nWe can pass images and text interspersed together in a chat:\n\n```\nchat = Chat(model)\nchat([img, \"In brief, what color flowers are in this image?\"])\n```\n\nThe flowers in this image are purple. They appear to be small, daisy-like flowers, possibly asters or some type of purple wildflower, blooming in the background behind the adorable puppy in the foreground.\n\n  * id: msg_01F2MAj2c2yUrPqLDhbAhtcc\n  * content: [{‘text’: ‘The flowers in this image are purple.

That means that the actual source code for the library is a rendered Jupyter Notebook which includes callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images, detailed explanations, and teaches _how_ and _why_ the code is written the way it is. Even if you’ve never used the Anthropic Python SDK or Claude API before, you should be able to read the source code. Check out Claudette’s Source to read it, or clone the git repo and execute the notebook yourself to see every step of the creation process in action. The reason this project is a new kind of literal program is because we take seriously Knuth’s call to action, that we have a “ _moral commitment_ ” to never write an “ _illiterate program_ ” – and so we have a commitment to making literate programming and easy and pleasant experience. (For more on this, see this talk from Hamel Husain.)\n\n&gt; “ _Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a**computer** what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to **human beings** what we want a computer to do._” Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming (1984)\n\nWhen you read the source, we’ll teach you not only how Claude works, but how Anthropic’s API works too! We’ll have more to say about this approach to coding at a later date, so stay tuned…\n\"\"\")\n\nThank you for sharing this detailed information about Claudette, Audrey.
