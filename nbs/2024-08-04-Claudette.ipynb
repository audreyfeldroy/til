    "Today, Anthropic launched the most powerful language model available: Claude 3.5 Sonnet. And today, we are making it ever better, with the launch of _Claudette_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claudette makes Anthropic’s SDK, which is used for working with Claude, much more convenient. The SDK works well, but it is quite low level – it leaves the developer to do a lot of stuff manually. That’s a lot of extra work and boilerplate. Claudette automates pretty much everything that can be automated, whilst providing full control. Amongst the features provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A `Chat` class that creates stateful dialogs\n",
    "  * Support for _prefill_ , which tells Claude what to use as the first few words of its response\n",
    "  * Convenient image support\n",
    "  * Simple and convenient support for Claude’s new Tool Use API.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re dying to get started, just `pip install claudette`, and follow along with the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick demo to give you a taste of what’s possible…\n",
    "\n",
    "## A tour of Claudette\n",
    "\n",
    "The main interface to Claudette is the `Chat` class, which provides a standard chat interface to Claude. If you use it in a Notebook environment, you even get nice little collapsible widgets with output details:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "chat = Chat(model, sp=\"You are a helpful and concise assistant.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that this library is the first ever “literate nbdev” project. That means that the actual source code for the library is a rendered Jupyter Notebook which includes callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images, detailed explanations, and teaches _how_ and _why_ the code is written the way it is. Even if you’ve never used the Anthropic Python SDK or Claude API before, you should be able to read the source code. Check out Claudette’s Source to read it, or clone the git repo and execute the notebook yourself to see every step of the creation process in action. The reason this project is a new kind of literal program is because we take seriously Knuth’s call to action, that we have a “ _moral commitment_ ” to never write an “ _illiterate program_ ” – and so we have a commitment to making literate programming and easy and pleasant experience. (For more on this, see this talk from Hamel Husain.)\n",

Knuth, Literate Programming (1984)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read the source, we’ll teach you not only how Claude works, but how Anthropic’s API works too! We’ll have more to say about this approach to coding at a later date, so stay tuned…\n",

While we provided a derivative function (df) in the initial implementation, we could make this optional and implement automatic differentiation. This would make the tool more flexible and user-friendly.\\n\\n2. Handling partial derivatives:\\nThis is crucial for optimizing multivariate functions, which are common in many real-world problems. Let\\'s extend our function to handle this case.\\n\\nHere\\'s an updated version that incorporates these ideas:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom typing import Callable, Union, List\\n\\ndef gradient_descent(\\n    f: Callable[[Union[float, List[float]]], float],  # Function to optimize\\n    start: Union[float, List[float]],                 # Starting point(s)\\n    learn_rate: float = 0.1,                          # Learning rate\\n    n_iter: int = 100,                                # Number of iterations\\n    df: Callable[[Union[float, List[float]]], Union[float, List[float]]] = None  # Optional derivative function\\n) -> Union[float, List[float]]:                       # Optimized value(s)\\n    \"\"\"Perform gradient descent to find the minimum of a function.\"\"\"\\n    x = np.array(start)\\n    \\n    def numerical_gradient(x):\\n        h = 1e-7\\n        grad = np.zeros_like(x)\\n        for i in range(len(x)):\\n            x_plus, x_minus = x.copy(), x.copy()\\n            x_plus[i] += h\\n            x_minus[i] -= h\\n            grad[i] = (f(x_plus) - f(x_minus)) / (2*h)\\n        return grad\\n    \\n    for i in range(n_iter):\\n        if df:\\n            grad = df(x)\\n        else:\\n            grad = numerical_gradient(x)\\n        \\n        x = x - learn_rate * grad\\n        print(f\"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x}, f(x) = {f(x)}\")\\n    \\n    return x.tolist() if len(x) > 1 else x[0]\\n```\\n\\nThis updated version:\\n1. Handles both univariate and multivariate functions.\\n2. Allows for an optional derivative function.\\n3. Uses numerical differentiation if no derivative function is provided.\\n4. Returns a single value for univariate functions and a list for multivariate functions.\\n\\nWe could use this tool for various applications:\\n\\n1. Optimizing machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression).\\n2. Solving systems of equations.\\n3. Finding minimum points in complex landscapes (useful in physics and engineering).\\n4. Optimizing portfolio allocations in finance.\\n\\nExtensions we could consider:\\n1. Implementing different variants like stochastic gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent.\\n2. Adding momentum or adaptive learning rates.\\n3. Incorporating constraints for constrained optimization problems.\\n4. Implementing early stopping based on convergence criteria.\\n\\nWhat do you think about these modifications and potential uses, Audrey?
